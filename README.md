There is an AI tool available on the Figma where we need to give the link and it provides the prototype. It can be used for the prototype generation. 
The plugin tool is **html.to.design** and it can generate the prototype. The other idea which I have is developed below.
I have also developed a full stack web application app with below idea explained:
1. Project Overview
Objective
Developing a tool that:
1.	Takes a webpage URL as input.
2.	Captures a full-page screenshot using Puppeteer.
3.	Converts it into an editable Figma prototype via Figma’s REST API.
Use Cases
•	Rapid prototyping from live websites.
•	UX analysis of existing web pages.
2. Technical Architecture

3. Implementation Details
 
3.1 Backend (Node.js)
Key Files:
•	index.js – Main server (Express + Puppeteer + Figma API integration).
•	.env – Stores FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN.

Endpoints:
Endpoint	Method	Description
/convert	POST	Accepts URL, returns Figma file link

3.2 Frontend (React)
Components:
•	App.js – Form input, error handling, result display.

4. Setup Guide
   
4.1 Prerequisites
•	Node.js ≥ v18
•	Figma account with API access

4.2 Installation
Backend:
bash
npm install express puppeteer axios cors dotenv
Frontend:
bash
npm install react axios

4.3 Environment Variables
plaintext
# .env (Backend)
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"
PORT=5000

5. Testing & Debugging
Test Cases:
1.	Valid URL: https://example.com → Returns Figma link.
2.	Invalid URL: example.com → Shows error.
3.	Figma API Failure: Invalid token → Logs 401 error.
